                              We all develop patterned responses to things that worry us. Keep in mind that responses are neither “good” nor “bad”—stress responses are different ways we’ve adapted to threatening circumstances. Which of the following patterns resonates with your current stress response
                           </p>
                     <p class="indent">Develop a mental health plan that fits your current stress response and needs. Remember that your response and needs may also change over the coming weeks and months. When it’s accessible, also feel and express gratitude, compassion, and hope. Recognize that most people—yourself included—are doing their best with the knowledge that they have. The goal is to have a good enough plan, not a perfect one!</p>
                     <p class="indent">Most of us need reassurance, advice, or a sympathetic ear during this difficult time. But be careful who you choose as a sounding board. The coronavirus is not the only thing that’s contagious. So are emotions! Avoid talking about the virus with people who tend to be negative or who reinforce and ramp up your fears. Turn to the people in your life who are thoughtful, level-headed, and good listeners.</p>

                     <p class="indent">It’s a frightening time. We’re in the midst of a worldwide pandemic, with many places at least partially shut down, others struggling to reopen safely. Some of us are in areas where the coronavirus infection rates are getting worse. Others are bracing for what may come next. And all of us are watching the headlines and wondering, “When is this going to end?”</p>
                     
                     <p class="indent">For many people, the uncertainty surrounding coronavirus is the hardest thing to handle. We still don’t know exactly how we’ll be impacted, how long this will last, or how bad things might get. And that makes it all too easy to catastrophize and spiral out into overwhelming dread and panic. But there are many things you can do—even in the face of this unique crisis—to manage your anxiety and fears.</p>

                     <h4 class="tm-history-title2">Many ways of coping</h4>
                     <p class="indent">
                        Coping is the process of responding effectively to problems and challenges. To cope well is to respond to the threat in ways that minimise its damaging impact. Coping can involve many different strategies and it’s likely you have your own preferred ones. These strategies can be classified in many ways, but a key distinction is between problem-focused and emotion-focused strategies.
                     </p> <br>
                     <h4 class="tm-history-title2">The Difference</h4>
                     <p class="indent">Problem-focused coping involves actively engaging with the outside world. This might mean making action plans, seeking further information about a threat, or confronting an adversary. Emotion-focused coping, in contrast, is directed inward, attempting to change how we respond emotionally to stressful events and conditions, rather than to change them at their source. Effective emotion-focused strategies include meditation, humour and reappraising difficulties to find benefits. Less effective emotion-focused strategies include seeking distractions, denial and substance use. Although these tactics may stave off distress in the short term, they neither address its causes nor prevent its longer term effects.</p>
                     <br>
                     <h4 class="tm-history-title2">Which is best?</h4>
                     <p class="indent">Neither of these coping strategies is intrinsically more or less effective than the other. Both can be effective for different kinds of challenges. Problem-focused strategies are said to work best when we can control the problem.
                     However, when we face an immovable challenge, it can be better to adjust our response to it using emotion-focused strategies, rather than battling fruitlessly against it.</p> <br><br>

                        <p class="indent">When you feel yourself getting caught up in fear of what might happen, try to shift your focus to things you can control. For example, you can’t control how severe the coronavirus outbreak is in your city or town, but you can take steps to reduce your own personal risk (and the risk you’ll unknowingly spread it to others), such as: </p><br>

                              Coming up with a structured plan for each day with clear boundaries between your working and private life will give you a sense of control amid the uncertainty. Try to divide your day into small activities and make sure you build in time to do things you enjoy, from pursuing your hobbies or exercising to spending time with your children or pets. Moreover, set a daily routine for work: take regular breaks, leave your desk for lunch, and have a fixed time to turn off. Additionally, focus on getting enough sleep and regularly eating healthy meals.

                           <p class="indent">
                              Physical activity can do wonders for your mental health – especially if you are feeling stressed. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity per week – or if you are very motivated, a combination of both. That’s as little as 15 minutes a day! WHO suggests these fitness tips to exercise at home:
                           </p><br>
                     <p><strong>Take short active breaks throughout the day: </strong>from performing domestic chores to playing with your children, short sessions of physical activities will keep you busy.</p><br>

                     <p><strong>Follow an online exercise class: </strong>thanks to the internet, there is a huge selection of online exercise courses, many of them are for free and can be found on YouTube.</p><br>

                     <p><strong>Walk: </strong>this tip may be simple, but it is still effective. Even at home, walking around will help you to remain active. If you have a call, for example, stand or walk around instead of sitting down.</p><br>
                     
                     <p> <strong>Stand up: </strong>the WHO recommends standing up every 30 minutes to reduce your sedentary time. If you are working from home, consider setting up a standing desk. During leisure time, follow cognitively stimulating activities: reading, board games or puzzles.</p><br>

                     <p><strong>Relax: </strong>Meditation and breathing exercises can help you to better cope with stress.</p>

                           <p class="indent">
                              Excessively checking updates of coronavirus news can leave you stressed and emotionally exhausted. Try to make a conscious effort to disconnect and build healthy news habits: turn off push notifications from news apps, seek factual information from trusted sources and set specific times for checking the news (i.e. once in the morning and evening). Watch the news with others to discuss any worries you might have and to avoid anxious thoughts going unchecked. Another tip is to look for positive, uplifting stories and good news amid the pandemic. Celebrating positive stories can boost your mood and wellbeing.

                        <p class="indent">
                           Try to spend time in nature as numerous studies have shown it has a positive effect on mental health. Spending just 20 minutes connecting with nature can help lower stress hormone levels. Consider taking a stroll in the park after work. Time spent in nature also contributes to your physical wellbeing, reducing blood pressure, heart rate, muscle tension, and stress hormones. Take Scandinavians as an example with their cultural tradition of “open-air life”: despite freezing temperatures, they dress for the weather and get outside as they are aware of the positive impact on mental health. Although the prospect might be daunting, once you are outside it feels better than you expected. With the winter months approaching, an alternative could be adding green elements (i.e. plants and flowers) to your place – simply having a plant on your work desk can reduce stress and anxiety and improve your mental health in the long term.

                        <h4>5. Reach out to others</h4>
                        <p class="indent">
                           Without social interactions provided by going into the office, working from home can feel lonely and isolating. Making time to reach out and connect with others is important for our mental health. Socializing decreases stress and anxiety while supporting calm and happy feelings. By talking to someone, we share our emotions and experiences, provide or receive support that makes us feel connected. When we socialize and have physical proximity to others, we reduce cortisol levels. Simply sharing our concerns with a loved one can help us feel better.
                        </p><br>
                        <p class="indent">
                           Talking to a friend or family member can be a helpful way to keep your stress levels under control. Plan at least one connection a day – a phone call or a chat with a colleague or friend with who you can share experiences. Consider regular virtual meetings with family and friends to check in on each other. This can be a great source of support during these times.

                        Taking care of yourself can better equip you to take care of others. During times of social distancing, it is especially important to stay connected with your friends and family. Helping others cope with stress through phone calls or video chats can help you and your loved ones feel less lonely or isolated.
